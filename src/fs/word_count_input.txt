1,MapReduce is a programming model and an associated
2,implementation for processing and generating large
3,data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a
4,key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value
5,pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate
6,values associated with the same intermediate key. Many
7,real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown
8,in the paper.
9,Programs written in this functional style are automatically
10,parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity
11,machines. The run-time system takes care of the
12,details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the program’s
13,execution across a set of machines, handling machine
14,failures, and managing the required inter-machine
15,communication. This allows programmers without any
16,experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily
17,utilize the resources of a large distributed system.
18,Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large
19,cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable:
20,a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes
21,of data on thousands of machines. Programmers
22,find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs
23,have been implemented and upwards of one thousand
24,MapReduce jobs are executed on Google’s clusters
25,every day.
